# Pokedex Web App

Here you can view a web application simulating the Pokedex from the hit franchise, Pokemon. You can view your favorite pokemon in list or grid view, and you may even filter by alphabetical order or by Pokemon entry number. 

All pokemon entry data is pulled from PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/).
